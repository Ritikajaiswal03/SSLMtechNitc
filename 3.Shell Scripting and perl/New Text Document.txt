1. Write a perl program that reads a list of numbers (on separate lines) from the terminal and for
each number print corresponding person’s name from the list shown below. (Hardcode this list of
names into your program’s source code)
Names: Snickers, Boots, Charlie, Belle, Panda, Lola, Sassy (1 mark)
Sample Input & Output
Input: Enter the numbers: 1
2
4
2
Output: Snickers, Boots, Belle, Boots

2.Given a string, calculate the sum of similarities of the string S with each of it’s suffixes using perl
program. For two strings A and B, similarity of the strings is defined to be the length of the longest
prefix common to both strings. (The similarity of strings ‘abc’ and ‘abd’ is 2, while the similarity
of strings ‘aaa’ and ‘aaab’ is 3.)
For example, if the string is ababaa then the suffixes of the string are ‘ababaa’, ‘babaa’, ‘abaa’,
‘baa’, ‘aa’ and ‘a’. The similarities of these strings with the string ‘ababaa’ are 6,0,3,0,1, & 1
respectively. Thus, the answer should be 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11
Condition: Each string contains only lower case characters (1 mark)
Sample Input & Output
Input: ababaa
Output: 11
Input: aa
Output: 3

3. A palindrome is a symmetric character sequence that looks the same when read backwards. Write
a program in Perl to detect whether a given string is palindrome with he following constraints:
(a) It should discard blank spaces and punctuation marks.
(b) It should be case sensitive.
(c) Your program should accept a string from the key board and output YES/NO.
Sample Input & Output (1 mark)
Input: “madam, I’m adam.”
Output: YES
Input: “Eve.”
Output: NO

4. According to Euclid’s formula, a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b, where a and b are two positive integers, and
q and r are two unique integers such that a = bq + r holds true. Write a program in Perl to accept
a and b as input and print q and r as output. (Assume a > b)
Sample Input & Output (0.5 mark)
Input: 24 8
Output: 3 0
Input: 13 5
Output: 2 3

5. Write a Perl program that reads a file with strings separated by a space. Check whether the second
string can be obtained from the first by the deletion of none, one or more characters. Output must
be either ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ depending on whether second string can be obtained from first string.
Sample Input & Output (1.5 mark)
Input text in file: hyderabad her
Output: YES
Input text in file:: hyderabad dear
Output: No
